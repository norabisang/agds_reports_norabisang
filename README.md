# AGDS Nora Bisang

## Project overview
This repository contains two analysis workflows developed for the AGDS course:

1. **Phenology modelling and spatial upscaling**
   - Implementation of a Growing Degree Day (GDD) phenology model
   - Calibration using PhenoCam data
   - Spatial upscaling using DAYMET temperature data
   - Evaluation against the MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology product

2. **Digital Soil Mapping**
   - (Short description of what you do there, 1–2 sentences)

The main outputs are HTML reports, spatial maps, and statistical comparisons.


## Data
### Raw data (`data-raw/`)
Raw data are obtained from external sources and are not modified:
- **PhenoCam** data downloaded via the `phenocamr` R package
- **DAYMET** daily temperature data
- **MODIS MCD12Q2** phenology product (requires Earthdata login)

Scripts for downloading the data are located in `data-raw/`.

> **Note:** MODIS data access requires an Earthdata account. Users must configure their credentials before running the MODIS download script.

### Processed data (`data/`)
Processed and intermediate datasets generated by the analysis scripts are stored in `data/`.

## How to reproduce the analysis
1. Clone the repository
2. Restore the R environment:

# Reproducibility
Restore the R environment with `renv::restore()` and knit the RMarkdown files in `analysis/`


Results

Rendered HTML reports can be found in the analysis/ directory after knitting.
Generated figures are stored in fig/.
